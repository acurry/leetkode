# leetkode

From time to time, I like to work on brain-teasers. Since [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) is probably the most well-known site for trivial programming problems, I figured it's a good site to use to keep my skills sharp.

## what's in this repo?

To improve my core Python skills and muscle memory for basic operations, most of my work on Leetcode problems is in Python. My everyday language for years now has been Typescript & Javascript, but Python is used more and more in the startup space these days, just from what I've seen.

## but why golang as well?

I started learning [Google's Go](https://go.dev/) in my spare time when I wanted a modern, low-level systems language that had almost everything one needs "out of the box". Formatter, dependency manager, linter, testing suite, and a gigantic set of standard libraries.

Over time, I really gained an appreciate for the tenets of go (these are just my thoughts):

- Prefer simple, readable code over clever code
- Go's performance, even with its dreaded [garbage collector](https://blog.devgenius.io/golang-garbage-collection-in-general-c28ae82558c4), is 99% of what anyone needs out of a language.
- I actually like Go's error handling. I hate super-long deeply-nested try/except blocks (coming from Python).
- Go is almost the perfect language for building small, modular web services. Go's http package is 99.9% of everything one would need for it.

## so what's the endgame for this repo?

Not sure. I'll keep working on these problems when I have time. It's fun to do these every once in a while, maybe a bunch at once in a day. I enjoy it more than trying to find a `#sideHustle` project to focus on.
